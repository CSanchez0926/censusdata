### The original decision back in 2015 involved "flagging" unusual responses by creating a separate variable. We chose to stick with the same method, but changed the decisions that were made in 2015 about the scoring of some of the variables.

### 0 = no problem/not altered 1 = slightly unusual 2 = extremely unusual (likely a problem)
